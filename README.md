# 0x15. C - Simple Shell



## Description

This team project is part of the first year curriculum of Alx School.

Simple Shell is a command line interpreter that replicates the **sh** program on Linux.

It can take in simple commands to navigate the terminal, manipulate files, and execute programs.



What we learned:

* How a shell works and finds commands

* Creating, forking and working with processes

* Executing a program from another program

* Handling dynamic memory allocation in a large program

* Pair programming and team work

* Building a test suite to check our own code



---



## Compile and run

```gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh```



```./hsh```



## Usage

* Prints a prompt and waits for a command from the user

* Creates a child process in which the command is checked

* Checks for built-ins, aliases in the PATH, and local executable programs

* The child process is replaced by the command, which accepts arguments

* When the command is done, the program returns to the parent process and prints the prompt

* The program is ready to receive a new command

* To exit: press Ctrl-D or enter "exit" (with or without a status)

* Works also in non interactive mode



## Examples

```bash

$ /bin/ls

foo main.c coquille.c README.md tests croissant.c

```

```bash

$ pwd

/home/vagrant/simple_shell

```

```bash

$ ls -l

total 60

drwxrwxr-x 7 vagrant vagrant  4096 Apr  7 01:48 foo

-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant   148 Apr  7 00:00 main.c

-rwxrw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant    28 Apr  7 15:35 coquille.c

```

```bash

$ baguette

./hsh: No such file or directory

```

```bash

$ echo "cat testfile" | ./hsh
$ echo "cat testfile"
This is a test file
